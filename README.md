# Project Movies

This week's pair programming project was about creating a movie site and practicing building a multi-page React app, using an API from TMDB.

## The problem

We began by mapping out the different components we will need to create a functioning movie website. We started by implementing the router and defining the links to move from page to page. After fetching data from the API we focused on showing all of the required elements on each of the pages.
We chose to use style components and found there to be a learning curve, but overall were able to fix a lot of the problems, such as hover effects and positioning of the image vs. text on the homepage.
